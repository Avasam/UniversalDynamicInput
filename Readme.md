**UniversalDynamicInput** is a custom button package for [dolphin emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/) it uses [dynamic input textures](https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-introducing-dynamic-input-textures-a-new-feature-for-controller-icons) to create custom buttons in real time.
Unlike traditional button packages, you can change the control settings at any time and there are no problems with texture packages.
