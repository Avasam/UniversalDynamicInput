This folder was generated using the `Generate_TwoPalettes_Flat_Mirror_from_DefaultDevices.ps1` script.  
It's a copy of [/#DefaultDevices/_Mirror/*/(Flat|Device)](/%23DefaultDevices/_Mirror) with the textures split in two palettes.  
The script can be run anytime a `*_Flat_Mirror` pack is updated to keep `TwoPalettes_Flat_Mirror` up to date.
