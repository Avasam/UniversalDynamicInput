 UniversalDynamicInput_Pack - by Venomalia
=================================================
This pack uses Dynamic Input Textures to create custom buttons in real time.
Unlike traditional custom button packs, you can change the contoler settings at any time and in any way you like
and since it is a function of dolphin, the actual intalation is very simple.
As the name suggests, I try to support as many games and input devices as possible and not to implement every game perfectly.

Sticks, Dpad and motion controls are currently difficult to implement with Dynamic Input Textures, this will probably change with the next version.
For more about Dynamic Input Textures info please visit the main thread.

I am constantly expanding this project and i am open for suggestions.

- Place the "DynamicInputTextures" into Dolphin's "load" directory,
 "%UserName%\Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Load"
 or when in portebel mode, Dolphin directory"\User\Load"

- Open Dolphin, enter Graphics > Advanced tab > Check Load Custom Textures.

- If it does not work immediately, please check your Contoller settings.

As soon as you start a supported game, Dolphin should generate and load the textures.
If it does not work immediately, please check your Contoller settings.

=================================================
Known Issues - Problem solving:
=================================================
- InputSyntax are not supported, like `button A`&`button B`.
 https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Input_Syntax
- Stick, dpad and motion controls are incomplete, this is not a mistake!
- Controls that are based on text cannot be changed, affected are
Mario Sunshine, Mario Kart Wii, F-Zero GX and Super Mario Galaxy1&2.

I See ? Buttens,
This means that your controller is not recognised or the button cannot be assigned.
- Input syntax is not possible, only individual buttons are recognised.
- The contoler is not port_1 for GC or Wiimote_1 for Wii? Check Contoller settings.
- You are using the wrong device or it is not supported? Check Supported Devices list.
  or you have several controllers? currently only the first one is supported!
  use "XInput_0_Gamepad" not "XInput_1_Gamepad"

I do not see any changes,
- Are custom textures active? Open Dolphin, enter Graphics > Advanced tab > Check Load Custom Textures.
- You are using the wrong device or it is not supported? Check Supported Devices list.
- You use Dolphin 5.0-13603 or newer?
- Is everything installed correctly? then a texture pack was generated for the game,
check Dolphin's "load\Textures" directory a #Generated_<GameName> directory should be existing!
If it doesn't, you must have done something wrong.
